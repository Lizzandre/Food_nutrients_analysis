## Nutritional Analysis of Foods Using USDA Data

This project dives into the nutritional composition of foods, analyzing data from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Composition Database. The objective was to identify foods with high levels of nutrients that can be detrimental in excess, like sugars and fats, while also highlighting nutrient-rich options. Through this analysis, valuable insights emerged about food composition, particularly the types of sugars, fats, and vitamins in various foods, which can influence dietary choices.

## Key Insights and Findings
### High-Sugar Foods:
Analysis of the top 20 sugar-rich foods revealed Strawberry beverage powder as the top item with more sugar content from the food items analized in the dataset. Many of these items with high sugar content are candies, like pineapple, butterscotch and tamarind candy. However, caution is required when interpreting this data, as not all sugars have the same impact. For example, foods like fruit peel, whey, and sweet potato paste contain sugars in fiber or polysaccharide forms, which differ in metabolic impact from monosaccharides or processed sugars.

### High-Fat Foods:
Items with the highest fat content include fat back, salt pork, and macadamia nuts. Notably: Fat back and salt pork contain more than 50% of their total fat as polysaturated and saturated fats. Macadamia nuts are high in monounsaturated fats, which are generally considered healthier.

### Vitamin-Rich Foods:
Foods with substantial vitamin content include beef liver, Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies, and Kellogg's S'mores. Among these: Beef liver stands out for its Vitamin A content. Kellogg's cereals provide a significant amount of vitamins, though they contain until 20 g of sugar, barely down from the recomended daily dosis intake, according to WHO (roughly 25 g), which could detract from their nutritional benefits.

Foods like vegetable mixes and sweet potato chips show relatively high vitamin content but are also notably high in fats, creating an imbalance that may diminish their overall health benefits. While they provide essential vitamins, the elevated fat levels—often from added oils—suggest that these foods may not be the healthiest choices despite their nutrient density, this will depend on individual dietary needs.
